The study occurred at the Institute of Noetic Sciences EarthRise Retreat Center and participants' homes. Thirty generally healthy older adults, aged 55-90, with depression symptoms were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to a 2-day retreat of either iRest meditation training or vacation. After the retreat, participants were asked to complete 20 minutes of home practice per day for 6 weeks; this consisted of either guided meditations (iRest) or music (vacation). Data were collected pre- and post-retreat and then 6 weeks later. Measures included depression-related variables (expectancy, depression symptoms, perceived stress, resilience, pain, sleep quality, and spirituality) and biomarkers (voice stress analysis, heart rate, heart rate variability).

Two randomized controlled trials were conducted (RCT1 n<sub>1</sub>=137, RCT2 n<sub>2</sub>=150). In both trials, extensive online questionnaires allowed individuals with CFS-like illness (i.e., symptoms match CFS, yet without clinical confirmation) to be identified.

       " [\"This meta-analytic review responds to promises in the research literature and public domain about the benefits of workplace mindfulness training. It synthesizes randomized controlled trial evidence from workplace-delivered training for changes in mindfulness, stress, mental health, well-being, and work performance outcomes. Going beyond extant reviews, this article explores the influence of variability in workforce and intervention characteristics for reducing perceived stress. Meta-effect estimates (Hedge's g) were computed using data from 23 studies. Results indicate beneficial effects following training for mindfulness (g = 0.45, p < .001) and stress (g = 0.56, p < .001), anxiety (g = 0.62, p < .001) and psychological distress (g = 0.69, p < .001), and for well-being (g = 0.46, p = .002) and sleep (g = 0.26, p = .003). No conclusions could be drawn from pooled data for burnout due to ambivalence in results, for depression due to publication bias, or for work performance due to insufficient data. The potential for integrating the construct of mindfulness within job demands-resources, coping, and prevention theories of work stress is considered in relation to the results. Limitations to study designs and reporting are addressed, and recommendations to advance research in this field are made. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).\"],\n",

Electronic databases searched included PsychINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and PubMed. Inclusion criteria were women with endometriosis, and interventions that used psychological or mind-body interventions; there were no exclusion criteria regarding study design. Studies were identified and coded using standard criteria, and risk of bias was assessed with established tools relevant to the study design. A total of 12 publications relating to 9 separate studies were identified:- 3 randomized controlled trials, 1 controlled trial, 2 single-arm studies, 1 retrospective cohort study, and 2 case series. Interventions included yoga, mindfulness, relaxation training, cognitive behavioural therapy combined with physical therapy, Chinese medicine combined with psychotherapy, and biofeedback. Results indicate that no studies have yet used gold-standard methodology and, thus, definitive conclusions cannot be offered about PMB efficacy. However, the results of these pilot studies suggest that PMB interventions show promise in alleviating pain, anxiety, depression, stress and fatigue in women with endometriosis, and future well-designed RCTs including active control groups are warranted.'],\n",

However, up to a quarter of patients dropout from cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia programmes. Acceptance, mindfulness and values-based actions may constitute complementary therapeutic tools to cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia. The current study sought to evaluate the efficacy of a remotely delivered programme combining the main components of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (sleep restriction and stimulus control) with the third-wave cognitive behavioural therapy acceptance and commitment therapy in adults with chronic insomnia and hypnotic dependence on insomnia symptoms and quality of life. Thirty-two participants were enrolled in a pilot randomized controlled trial: half of them were assigned to a 3-month waiting list before receiving the four \"acceptance and commitment therapy-enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia\" treatment sessions using videoconference. The primary outcome was sleep quality as measured by the Insomnia Severity Index and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. All participants also filled out questionnaires about quality of life, use of hypnotics, depression and anxiety, acceptance, mindfulness, thought suppression, as well as a sleep diary at baseline, post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. A large effect size was found for Insomnia Severity Index and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, but also daytime improvements, with increased quality of life and acceptance at post-treatment endpoint in acceptance and commitment therapy-enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia participants. Improvement in Insomnia Severity Index and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was maintained at the 6-month follow-up. Wait-list participants increased their use of hypnotics, whereas acceptance and commitment therapy-enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia participants evidenced reduced use of them. This pilot study suggests that web-based cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia incorporating acceptance and commitment therapy processes may be an efficient option to treat chronic insomnia and hypnotic dependence.'],\n",
       " [\"Psycho-affective states or traits such as stress, depression, anxiety and neuroticism are known to affect sleep, cognition and mental health and well-being in aging populations and to be associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mental training for stress reduction and emotional and attentional regulation through meditation practice might help reduce these adverse factors. So far, studies on the impact of meditation practice on brain and cognition in aging are scarce and have limitations but the findings are encouraging, showing a positive effect of meditation training on cognition, especially on attention and memory, and on brain structure and function especially in frontal and limbic structures and insula. In line with this, we showed in a pilot study that gray matter volume and/or glucose metabolism was higher in six older adult expert meditators compared to 67 age-matched controls in the prefrontal, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, insula and temporo-parietal junction. These preliminary findings are important in the context of reserve and brain maintenance as they suggest that long-term meditation practice might help preserve brain structure and function from progressive age-related decline. Further studies are needed to confirm these results with larger samples and in randomized controlled trials and to investigate the mechanisms underlying these meditation-related effects. The European Commission-funded project Silver Santé Study will address these challenges by studying 316 older adults including 30 expert meditators and 286 meditation-naïve participants (either cognitively normal or with subjective cognitive decline). Two randomized controlled trials will be conducted to assess the effects of 2-month and 18-month meditation, English learning or health education training programs (versus a passive control) on behavioral, sleep, blood sampling and neuroimaging measures. This European research initiative illustrates the progressive awareness of the benefit of such non-pharmacological approaches in the prevention of dementia and the relevance of taking into account the psycho-affective dimension in endeavoring to improve mental health and well-being of older adults.\"],\n",

The objective of the paper is to examine the appropriateness, feasibility, and potential cost-effectiveness of an online mindfulness intervention, designed to reduce anxiety and depression for people with Parkinson's. We conducted a feasibility randomized control trial and qualitative interviews. Anxiety, depression, pain, insomnia, fatigue, impact on daily activities and health-related quality of life were measured at baseline, 4, 8, and 20 weeks. Semi-structured interviews were conducted at the end of the intervention. Participants were randomized to the Skype delivered mindfulness group (n = 30) or wait-list (n = 30). Participants in the mindfulness group were also given a mindfulness manual and a CD with mindfulness meditations. The intervention did not show any significant effects in the primary or secondary outcome measures. However, there was a significant increase in the quality of life measure. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated to be £27,107 per Quality-Adjusted Life Year gained. Also, the qualitative study showed that mindfulness is a suitable and acceptable intervention. It appears feasible to run a trial delivering mindfulness through Skype, and people with Parkinson's found the sessions acceptable and helpful.\"],\n",

ASCO considered the guideline for endorsement. Methods The SIO guideline addressed the use of integrative therapies for the management of symptoms and adverse effects, such as anxiety and stress, mood disorders, fatigue, quality of life, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, lymphedema, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, pain, and sleep disturbance. Interventions of interest included mind and body practices, natural products, and lifestyle modifications. SIO systematic reviews focused on randomized controlled trials that were published from 1990 through 2015. The SIO guideline was reviewed by ASCO content experts for clinical accuracy and by ASCO methodologists for developmental rigor. On favorable review, an ASCO Expert Panel was convened to review the guideline contents and recommendations. Results The ASCO Expert Panel determined that the recommendations in the SIO guideline-published in 2017-are clear, thorough, and based on the most relevant scientific evidence. ASCO endorsed the guideline with a few added discussion points. Recommendations Key recommendations include the following: Music therapy, meditation, stress management, and yoga are recommended for anxiety/stress reduction. Meditation, relaxation, yoga, massage, and music therapy are recommended for depression/mood disorders. Meditation and yoga are recommended to improve quality of life. Acupressure and acupuncture are recommended for reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Acetyl-l-carnitine is not recommended to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy because of a possibility of harm. No strong evidence supports the use of ingested dietary supplements to manage breast cancer treatment-related adverse effects.

Interventions that promote health must be studied and implemented to make the aging process be with quality of life. Depression and anxiety are the most common mental health conditions that compromise the quality of life on the elderly and it can cause damage to the autonomy and activities of daily life. Mindfulness training has been shown to improve psychological health and quality of life on adults. Studies involving Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) with older people are scarce in the literature, but they have been increasing in recent years showing promising results for healthy aging. This trial will investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an MBI on the quality of life of elderly assisted in the Primary Care. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> A cohort-nested randomized controlled trial with 3 assessment points (baseline, post-intervention and 1-year follow up) will be conducted to compare a MBI program (Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion) to a cognitive stimulation control-group in a Primary Care facility. One-hundred and two older adults will be recruited from a cohort of this facility and they will be randomized and allocated into an intervention group (<i>N</i> = 76) and the control group (<i>N</i> = 76). The primary outcome evaluated will be the improvement of quality of life assessed by the WHOQOL-BREF and WHOQOL-OLD. The secondary outcomes will be cognitive function, psychological health, sleep quality, self-compassion, and religiosity. Qualitative data will be assessed by focus group and the word free evocation technique. The feasibility of the program will also be evaluated by adherence and unwanted effects questionnaires. <b>Discussion:</b> This cohort-nested clinical trial will be the first mixed-methods study with 3 assessment points which will study the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a mindfulness-based program for older people in Latin America population.

To evaluate long-term effects of the intervention, we also scheduled a follow-up 6 months after completion of the study intervention. <b>Results:</b> Forty-five patients were randomized to either AE (<i>n</i> = 23) or the placebo intervention (<i>n</i> = 22); 36 patients completed the 6-week intervention. In the AE group, 65% completed all 18 training sessions. Patients who were less physically active prior to admission were less likely to complete the study. With regard to energy expenditure, mean kcal/kg/week was 16.4 kcal/kg/week (range: 13.8-17.7), coming close to the targeted dose of 17.5 kcal/kg/week. <b>Conclusions:</b> Overall, patients showed good adherence to the intervention protocol despite at least moderate depression severity. However, the dropout rate suggests that depressed inpatients may need special support to adhere to a structured exercise intervention program. This study will add evidence on the effects of AE as an add-on to inpatient treatment of moderate to severe depression. Besides antidepressant effects, potentially beneficial effects of AE on a broad array of further variables associated with depression will be evaluated. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT02679053.'],\n",
       " [\"Objective This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the effectiveness of occupational e-mental health interventions aimed at stress, depression, anxiety, burnout, insomnia, mindfulness, well-being, and alcohol misuse and their potential treatment moderators. Methods We systematically reviewed randomized control trials published in English using three electronic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL) and three register trials. A pooled effect size for each mental health area was calculated using random-effects modelling. For each meta-analysis, we conducted an analysis of potential moderators (ie, type of recruitment, age, gender, initial psychological symptoms, guidance, therapy type, and study quality). Results In total, 50 studies were included in the systematic review, and 34 studies were included in the meta-analyses. We noted moderate treatment effects on stress (Hedges'g=0.54), insomnia (g=0.70), and burnout (g=0.51) and small treatment effects on depression (g=0.30), anxiety (g=0.34), well-being (g=0.35), and mindfulness (g=0.42). The pooled effect on alcohol intake was small and nonsignificant. Conclusions Our results suggest that occupational e-mental health interventions are associated with significant health improvements. However, more research is required to understand which factors contribute to the variation in effectiveness of particular interventions depending on the mental health area and characteristics of participants and interventions.\"],\n",

The primary outcome was the current degree of subjectively experienced stress assessed with the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) at a 9-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included burnout symptoms, well-being, health status, sleep disorders, expectation of self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, ability to work, pain, and days of sick leave. Assessments were conducted at baseline, 12 days (end of program), and 1 (start telephone-coaching), 3, 6 (end of telephone-coaching), and 9 months. Data from 103 adults (TC = 51; noTC = 52), mostly fulltime farmers, were available for analysis (mean age: 55.3; 49.1% female). Participants experienced significant immediate improvement in all outcome measurements, which declined somewhat during the first three months after the end of SGS and then remained stable for at least another six months. While within-group changes from baseline to 9 months showed significant improvements at medium to large effect sizes for all target variables (PSQ-total, TC: -13.38 (±14.98); 95%-CI: (-17.68; -9.07); noTC: -11.09 (±14.15); 95%-CI: (-15.11; -7.07)), no statistically significant differences were found between the groups at any time and for any target variable (between-group ANCOVA for PSQ-total at 9 months, parameter estimator for the group: -1.58; 95%-CI: (-7.29; 4.13)). The stress-prevention program SGS is a feasible, effective, and practical way to reduce perceived stress and improve participants' resources. Four subsequent telephone-coaching sessions do not seem to contribute to a further improvement in the results.\"],\n",
       " ['This double-blind, two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of gamma-frequency rhythmic sensory stimulation on fibromyalgia. We were interested in whether rhythmic sensory stimulation would promote significant changes in fibromyalgia and associated symptoms, and whether treatment effects would differ between two distinct treatment parameters. Fifty patients with a formal diagnosis of fibromyalgia were randomly assigned to two test groups. One group received vibrotactile stimulation from a continuous sine wave single-frequency stimulation (40 Hz) for 30 minutes, five days per week, over five weeks, concomitant with usual care. The second group completed the same treatment protocol but received a different stimulation, consisting of random and intermittent complex wave gamma-range vibrotactile stimulation. Fibromyalgia symptoms, pain severity and interference, depression symptoms, quality of life and sleep quality were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Results indicated that there were statistically significant changes from baseline to post-treatment in measures of fibromyalgia symptom severity, pain interference, depression, and sleep quality. However, treatment outcomes did not differ significantly between groups. These findings provide preliminary evidence that gamma-frequency rhythmic vibroacoustic stimulation may decrease fibromyalgia symptoms and ease associated comorbidities, opening new avenues for further investigation of the effects of rhythmic sensory stimulation on chronic pain conditions.'],\n",

Unfortunately, the application of these treatments in milder forms of illness and subclinical samples, which affect a substantial portion of the population, is not justifiable by their costs (e.g. cognitivebehavioral therapy) and/or potential for side effects (serotonin-reuptake inhibitors associated sexual side effects). As such, there is an urgent need to develop simple yet effective treatments, such as modifiable lifestyle interventions, that can be employed on a broader scale. Here, we review the current state of evidence that supports or refutes the efficacy of lifestyle approaches for OCRDs. We focus on dimensions of lifestyle that are deemed important for cardiovascular diseases; namely, physical activity, stress, sleep, diet and eating behaviors, alcohol consumption, and smoking. Despite the relative scarcity of welldesigned randomized controlled trials targeting unhealthy life styles in OCRDs, we found meditation-based therapies and interventions focusing on eliminating sedentarism to be promising approaches. In the future, these strategies may represent valid alternative for subjects with subthreshold symptoms or at risk for OCRDs or other \"compulsive\" disorders.']]"

       "'To explore the effects of acupuncture (manual acupuncture or electroacupuncture) combined with SSRIs for moderate to severe depression improving major clinical symptoms and life quality of the patients on secondary outcomes. Pragmatic, parallel, randomized controlled trial. 6 hospitals in China. 6 weeks of manual acupuncture (MA)+selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), electroacupuncture (EA)+SSRIs, and SSRIs alone. The primary outcome was response rate of 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17) total score at 6<sup>th</sup> week. The secondary outcomes reported in this analysis were HAMD-17 factor scores at 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup> week and WHO Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) scores at 6<sup>th</sup> week. 477 patients were randomly assigned into MA\\u2009+\\u2009SSRIs (n\\u2009=\\u2009161), EA\\u2009+\\u2009SSRIs (n\\u2009=\\u2009160), or SSRIs alone (n\\u2009=\\u2009156) groups. For HAMD-17 (at 6<sup>th</sup> week), the MA\\u2009+\\u2009SSRIs group was significantly better than the SSRIs alone group in retardation factor (p\\u2009=\\u20090.008), while the EA+SSRIs group was significantly better than the SSRIs alone group in anxiety/somatization factor (p<0.001) and sleep disturbance factor (p\\u2009=\\u20090.002). For WHOQOL-BREF (at 6<sup>th</sup> week), the EA\\u2009+\\u2009SSRIs group, compared with the SSRIs alone group, produced a more significant improvement in the overall quality of life, general health, physical health, and psychological health (p<0.05). While, the MA\\u2009+\\u2009SSRIs group, compared to the SSRIs alone group, showed significant advantage only in psychological health (p\\u2009=\\u20090.023). Either MA or EA combined SSRIs treatment could improve symptoms and quality of life for patients with moderate to severe depression. The main limitation of this trial was not using a sham control therefore the placebo effect could not be excluded.'"
